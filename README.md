# Overview
I am always looking to strengthen my understanding of different programming languages and explore their unique features. This project is designed to demonstrate the fundamentals of the R programming language, including data types, loops, dataframes, and working with CSV files.

The software consists of multiple functions that showcase core R concepts:  
- Handling and displaying different data types (numeric, character, logical, vectors, lists)  
- Looping through lists to display elements  
- Creating, analyzing, and filtering dataframes  
- Combining multiple dataframes  
- Working with CSV files to read, write, and perform basic calculations  
- Using a `switch` case block to perform simple operations  

The purpose of this project is to build a foundation in R, learn how to structure code effectively, and gain practical experience working with R’s syntax and standard data structures.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
