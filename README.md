# Overview
I am always looking to strengthen my understanding of different programming languages and explore their unique features. This project is designed to demonstrate the fundamentals of the R programming language, including data types, loops, dataframes, and working with CSV files.

The software consists of multiple functions that showcase core R concepts:  
- Handling and displaying different data types (numeric, character, logical, vectors, lists)  
- Looping through lists to display elements  
- Creating, analyzing, and filtering dataframes  
- Combining multiple dataframes  
- Working with CSV files to read, write, and perform basic calculations  
- Using a `switch` case block to perform simple operations  

The purpose of this project is to build a foundation in R, learn how to structure code effectively, and gain practical experience working with R’s syntax and standard data structures.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment
This project was developed using **Visual Studio Code** with the R extension installed. The programming language is **R**, and all functionality is implemented using **base R functions**, so no external libraries are required. For package management and future reproducibility, the `renv` package was optionally used to create a project-specific environment.

# Future Work

- Expand the project to include more advanced data manipulation using packages like `dplyr`  
- Add visualization features using `ggplot2` to graph data from dataframes and CSV files  
- Include more interactive functionality for users, such as input prompts or a menu system  
- Integrate real-world datasets from online sources using web scraping or APIs
